Allows health and human service websites the ability search community resources utilizing the Resource House API.

== Description ==

In June 2016 Revation Systems updated the Washington State 2-1-1 Community Resources Directory to the newest version 
of Resource House Public Portal.  This new search engine utilizes a new and enhanced underlying api which allows
for a variety of search keywords, taxonomy terms, location data, and feature filter options.

form to their websites.  

The plugin offers the following features:

 *   Shortcode [win211search] adds a form to any webpage
